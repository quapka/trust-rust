# Trust Rust or actually not?

The claims about Rust memory safety, no race conditions etc. sounds awesome. However, it would be nicer to actually understand as much as possible, how are they achieved and _where_ are the caveats. It all sounds a bit too awesome. But I'm happy to be amazed by Rust. I am already enjoying it quite a lot I must say.
